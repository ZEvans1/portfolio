          <h2 class="aboutme"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
          <p>I've spent almost my entire life in Oregon. I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, but have now spent nearly 20 years living in Oregon. I obtained a degree in chemical engineering from Oregon State University, spent the last year working for a company that produces high purity chemicals for the semiconductor industry, and I have come to Epicodus to change the direction of my career.</p>

          <p>I'm generally interested in almost everything, but there are a few things that I invest more of my time to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coffee (background image!)</li>
            <li>Playing and listening to music (instrumental metal, jazz, classical  Indian music)</li>

The sidebar on the right side of this page summarizes the project titles. Click on the project title (within the sidebar or below) to visit the project's Git repository. </p>

          <p>The purpose of this project was to emulate the front page of Wikipedia as closely as possible (not including functionality). This project essentially reviewed all of the content that was covered during the week.</p>

          <img src="img/europa.jpg" alt="europa pic" class="img-thumbnail">
          <p>The focus of the vacation project was to create a page for a vacation destination and to begin using Bootstrap. Specific examples include: Jumbotron, blockquotes, and helper classes.</p>

          <img src="img/interior.jpg" alt="pic of home interior" class="img-thumbnail">
          <p>A page for a fictional interior decorator. This page was made to practice using floats. It also was made to practice using media queries. The page will change as you adjust the width of the page.</p>

          <p>This page about an animal shelter was made to practice cascading styles and to understand the concept of inheritance.</p>

          <ul>

          <img src="img/aal.jpg" alt="pic of band tour page" class="img-thumbnail">
          <p>A page for the band Animals as Leaders. Floats were used for this time during this project. I don't think I quite had a full handle on them while it was made because the sidebar is having an impact on the image spacing. This project also focused on implementing the box model.</p>
